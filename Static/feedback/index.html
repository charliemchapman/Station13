      <p> If you have any thoughts or comments about anything we talk about on
      the podcast, we'd love to hear it!  You can tweet Alex <a
      href="https://twitter.com/ATYPE808">@ATYPE808</a>, Dani <a
      href="https://twitter.com/danielpwright">@danielpwright</a>, or the show as
      a whole <a href="https://twitter.com/Station13FM">@Station13FM</a>.  You
      can also email us at <a
      href="mailto:station13@fastmail.com">station13@fastmail.com</a>.</p>

      <p>If you do choose to contact us, we may decide to mention it on the show.
      If you would prefer we didn't, please let us know.  In general we'll refer
      to you by your twitter handle, or in the case of email your first name
      only, but if you have a handle you'd rather we use, or you don't want us
      to mention a name at all, just say the word!</p>

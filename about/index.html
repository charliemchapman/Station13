        <h1>About the Podcast</h1>

        <p>Alex May and Dani Wright used to work together, making videogames in
        Kyoto, and spend their commute on the Hankyu train discussing all manner
        of topics&mdash;games, of course, but also design, typography, mechanical
        watches, philosophy, and life in Japan.  Now that Dani has moved to
        California, the conversation continues here, on the <i>Station 13</i>
        podcast.</p>
